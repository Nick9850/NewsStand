**# Purpose**

We created a News channel where all the lastest news will be accesible for this generation. We are always looking for easy and quick information.

The Millenial Newsstand is a hub for our generation to quickly and easily access the latest headlines and other searchable topics.

As Millennials, we want to see the daily news and our favorite topics at a glance so that I can stay up-to-date.
